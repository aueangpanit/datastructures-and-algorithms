Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

Constraints:

```
2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
```

## Approach 1: Brute Force

The brute force approach is simple. Loop through each element _x_ and find if there is another value that equals to _target - x_.

```js
function twoSums(nums, target) {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
    for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++)
      if (nums[i] + nums[j] === target) return [i, j]

  return false
}
```

The visuals below illustrates the process of the Brute Force approach.

Time complexity: O(n^2)

Space complexity: O(1)

## Approach 2: Hash Table

While we iterate and inserting elements into the table, we also look back to check if current element's complement already exists in the table. If it exists, we have found a solution and return immediately.

```js
function twoSums(nums, target) {
  const map = {}

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const n = nums[i]
    if (typeof map[n] === "number") return [map[target - n], i]
    map[target - n] = i
  }

  return false
}
```

The visuals below illustrates the process of the Hash Table approach.

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(n)

## Approach 3: Sort then Two Pointers

If the array is sorted, then it is posible to find the two sums by using two pointers. Assuming that we sort in acending order then, starting at each end move the left pointer up if the sum of the current numbers is less than the target. Similarly, move the the right pointer down if the current sum is more than the target. Return when the sum is equal to the target otherwise terminate when the left pointer is next to the right pointer.

```js
function twoSums(nums, target) {
  nums.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a < b) return -1
    else if (a > b) return 1
    return 0
  })

  let i = 0
  let j = nums.length - 1

  while (i < j) {
    const sum = nums[i] + nums[j]
    if (sum === target) return [i, j]
    else if (sum < target) i++
    else j--
  }

  return []
}
```

The visual below illustrates this process.

The time and space complexity mostly depends on the sorting algorithm used. If Quick sort is used then sorting requires O(nlog(n)) time and O(log(n)) space. The two pointers algorithm requires O(n) time and O(1) space. In this case the overall time and space complexities are given below:

Time complexity: O(nlog(n)).

Space complexity: O(log(n)).
